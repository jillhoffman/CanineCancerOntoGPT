  The aim of the conducted investigations was to identify differences in the D-loop nucleotide sequence between neoplastic tissue, normal tissue, and blood and to determine their correlation with the type of cancer in dogs. In 62.5% of the analyzed tumors of epithelial origin and 25% tumors of mesenchymal origin, substitution was detected within the D-loop sequence between the neoplastic tissue, normal tissue, and blood. Two mutations occurring in the carcinogenic process in position T15620C have been identified in epithelioma glandulae sebacei and carcinoma planoepithelialae keratodes. Blood and cancer heteroplasmy was diagnosed for carcinoma planoepithelialae keratodes and “Comedo” carcinoma. The results of the study indicate that polymorphic changes in the D-loop sequence promote carcinogenesis in dogs. Heteroplasmy diagnosed in blood and tumor cells and absence thereof in normal tissue may imply mtDNA recombination. High prevalence of mtDNA mutations in canine tumors may suggest mtDNA genetic instability, which is likely to play a role in carcinogenesis.
