  Cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2) is associated with inflammatory microenvironment and tumour progression. COX-2 expression was reported in canine tumours, and anti-COX treatment showed therapeutic effects in selected tumour types. Currently, direct comparisons between different tumour types or reports were impossible due to varying evaluation protocols. Additionally, COX-2 expression in relatively uncommon tumours were yet to be evaluated. Here, we analysed COX-2 expression across various tumour types in dogs in a consistent protocol, aiming to revisit accumulated evidence in the field and report novel candidate tumours for anti-COX therapy. COX-2 expression in 32 histological types of tumours, which consisted of 347 samples in total, was investigated using immunohistochemistry followed by the Belshaw’s method scoring (range: 0–12). More than the half of the samples expressed COX-2 in mast cell tumours, transitional cell carcinoma in the urinary tract, squamous cell carcinoma, liposarcoma, and melanoma, with COX-2 median scores ranging from 1–8. On the other hand, <20% tissues expressed COX-2 in the half of tumour types investigated. Overall COX-2 positive rate was 27%. In conclusion, the results confirmed COX-2 expression in the well-known COX-2-expresing tumour types and suggested novel candidate tumours for anti-COX-2 therapy. At the same time, overall COX-2 expression was low, and inter- and intra-histology heterogeneity was apparent. This study will provide a foundation reference for future research in canine tumours.
