  Canine urothelial carcinoma (UC) initially responds favorably to treatment, but is ultimately lethal in most cases. Research to identify modifiable risk factors to prevent the cancer is essential. The high breed-associated risk for UC, e.g. 20-fold higher in Scottish terriers, can facilitate this research. The objective was to identify environmental and host factors associated with UC in a cohort of Scottish terriers. Information was obtained through dog owner questionnaires for 120 Scottish terriers ≥ 6 years old participating in a bladder cancer screening study, with comparisons made between dogs that did or did not develop UC during the 3 years of screening. Univariable models were constructed, and variables with P < 0.20 were included when building the multivariable model, and then removed using a backward stepwise procedure. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Urine cotinine concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to further investigate potential cigarette smoke exposure. Biopsy-confirmed UC which was found in 32 of 120 dogs, was significantly associated with the dogs living in a household with cigarette smokers (odds ratio [OR], 6.34; 95 % confidence intervals [CI], 1.16–34.69; P = 0.033), living within a mile of a marsh or wetland (OR, 21.23; 95 % CI, 3.64–123.69; P = 0.001), and history of previous bladder infections (OR, 3.87; 95 % CI, 1.0–14.98; P = 0.050). UC was diagnosed in 18 of 51 dogs (35.3 %) with quantifiable cotinine concentrations, and six of 40 dogs (15.0 %) without quantifiable cotinine concentrations in their urine (P = 0.0165). In conclusion, the main modifiable risk factor for UC in this cohort of dogs was exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.
