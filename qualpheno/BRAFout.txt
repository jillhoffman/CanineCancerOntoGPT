  Activating mutations of the BRAF gene lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The characterization and discovery of BRAF mutations in a variety of human cancers has led to the development of specific inhibitors targeting the BRAF/MAPK pathway and dramatically changed clinical outcomes in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Recent discovery of BRAF mutation in canine cancers underscores the importance of MAPK pathway activation as an oncogenic molecular alteration evolutionarily conserved between species. A comparative approach using the domestic dog as a spontaneous cancer model will provide new insights into the dysregulation of BRAF/MAPK pathway in carcinogenesis and facilitate in vivo studies to evaluate therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway’s molecules for cancer therapy. The BRAF mutation in canine cancers may also represent a molecular marker and therapeutic target in veterinary oncology. This review article summarizes the current knowledge on BRAF mutations in human and canine cancers and discusses the potential applications of this abnormality in veterinary oncology.
