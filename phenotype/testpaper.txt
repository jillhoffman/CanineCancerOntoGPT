Naturally occurring canine cancers have remarkable similarities to their human counterparts. To
better understand these similarities, we investigated 671 client-owned dogs from 96 breeds with
23 common tumor types, including those whose mutation profile are unknown (anal sac carcinoma
and neuroendocrine carcinoma) or understudied (thyroid carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma and
hepatocellular carcinoma). We discovered mutations in 50 well-established oncogenes and tumor
suppressors, and compared them to those reported in human cancers. As in human cancer, TP53 is
the most commonly mutated gene, detected in 22.5% of canine tumors overall. Canine tumors share
mutational hotspots with human tumors in oncogenes including PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, KIT and
EGFR. Hotspot mutations with significant association to tumor type include NRAS G61R and PIK3CA
H1047R in hemangiosarcoma, ERBB2 V659E in pulmonary carcinoma, and BRAF V588E (equivalent
of V600E in humans) in urothelial carcinoma. Our findings better position canines as a translational model of human cancer to investigate a wide spectrum of targeted therapies.

“Dogs with the most common splenic form of hemangiosarcoma will usually arrive at an emergency clinic having suddenly collapsed and with pale gums due to internal bleeding from a previously undetected and now ruptured tumor,” says Kelly Sams, lab manager at the Coonrod Lab at Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine’s Baker Institute for Animal Health. Internal bleeding sometimes results in sudden death.

By the time a dog shows any symptoms of this cancer, according to Sams, the disease has progressed and usually spread. Symptoms include loss of appetite, ataxia (instability), fatigue, weakness, and pale gums. There can be little or no sign of the disease before the dog may suddenly collapse or even die.
